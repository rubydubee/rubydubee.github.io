<center><h3> Hi! My name is Pradyumna Dandwate</h3></center>

I am a programmer and co-founder of [CourseBuffet](http://www.coursebuffet.com). I am also working as a Rails developer for [@Appthority](http://www.twitter.com/appthority). Previously I have worked for [@Pactapp](http://www.twitter.com/pactapp) and [@Avaya](http://www.twitter.com/Avaya). My interest lies in Web applications, Databases, APIs and things like that! I have a B.Tech degree in Computer Science from [COEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Engineering,_Pune). 

If I am not coding, I mostly like to read(anything ranging from Tech books to Mythology), listen to music, sketch or just go for walk :)
